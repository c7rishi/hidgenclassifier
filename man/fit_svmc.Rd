\title{Hidden genome SVM classifier (svmc)}
\usage{
fit_svmc(X, Y, backend = "liquidSVM", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{data design matrix with observations across rows and predictors across
columns. For a typical hidden genome classifier each row represents a tumor and
the columns represent (possibly normalized by some functions of
the total mutation burden in tumors) binary 1-0 presence/absence indicators
of raw variants, counts of mutations at specific genes and counts of mutations
corresponding to specific mutation signatures etc.}

\item{Y}{character vector or factor denoting the cancer type of tumors whose
mutation profiles are listed across the rows of \code{X}.}

\item{backend}{the backend to use. Either "e1071" or "liquidSVM". Defaults to
"liquidSVM"}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to e1071:tune.svm, or
liquidSVM::svm.}
}
\description{

\details{
Light wrapper around e1071::svm or liquidSVM::mcSVM to use in hidden
genome classification
